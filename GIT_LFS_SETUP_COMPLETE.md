# ✅ Git LFS Setup Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Large files that exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit have been successfully configured for Git LFS:

- `models/best.ckpt` (317.64 MB) → Now tracked by LFS
- `models/latest.ckpt` (317.67 MB) → Now tracked by LFS  
- `models/model.onnx` (105.67 MB) → Now tracked by LFS
- `models/model.ts` (106.26 MB) → Now tracked by LFS

## 📊 Repository Status
- **Repository size**: 63.77 MiB (well under GitHub limits)
- **LFS tracked files**: 4 large model files
- **Ready for GitHub push**: ✅ YES

## 🔧 What Was Done

1. **Initialized Git LFS**
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. **Configured .gitattributes**
   ```
   *.ckpt filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
   *.onnx filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
   *.ts filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
   *.pth filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
   *.h5 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
   *.pkl filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
   ```

3. **Created Clean Repository**
   - No large files in Git history (started fresh)
   - All large files properly tracked by LFS from the beginning
   - Repository size optimized for GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps - Push to GitHub

1. **Add your GitHub remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## 🛠️ Automation Scripts Created

Two scripts are available for future use:

- **Windows**: `cleanup_large_files.ps1`
- **Unix/Linux**: `cleanup_large_files.sh`

These scripts automate the entire LFS setup process for future projects.

## 📋 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check LFS tracked files
git lfs ls-files

# Check repository size
git count-objects -vH

# Verify LFS status
git lfs status
```

## ✨ Result
Your repository is now ready to push to GitHub without any size limit errors!
